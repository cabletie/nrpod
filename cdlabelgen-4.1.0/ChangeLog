2009-11-25

  * Version still 4.1.0, no change to cdlabelgen

  * cdinsert.pl 3.21 added -sPAPERSIZE= to ps2pdf so A4 PDFs can be
    correctly created.

  * cdinsert.pl now supports "Omit title/subtitle from Cover" option.

  * Removed RPM package - using Ubuntu desktop right now, and the
    rpmbuild -ta cdlabelgen-n.n.n.tgz
    command fails at the check files stage, seems like no .rpm was created.
    So only .tgz available now.

  * cdinsert.pl comment added for fixing bug in QRcode.pm

2008-10-25

  4.1.0

  * Create covers for double-sided DVD cases that hold 6 DVDs.

    Thanks to Andras Salamon <asalamon@chello.hu> for this patch.

  * cdinsert.pl changed to handle new cgi_error() processing
    from CGI.pm - also don't use CGI.pm 3.15 - has bug in handling POST_MAX,
    large posts will peg CPU to 100%. And edited the .tmpl template files
    to display links to GIF/PDF/PS only if those files have size > 0 bytes.

  * 2008-11-05 Make RPM version package available, rebuilt all packages.
    

2007-08-26

  4.0.0

      --tray-overlay-scaleratio option may be used, it has arguments:
      <eps_scaleratio [,image_x_offset,image_y_offset_inches]>
    The barcode utility, barcodegen, can be used with above option
    to print barcodes in cdinserts - GD::Barcode::Image
    Requires that GD, GD::Barcode, Image::Magick be installed on the system 
    The online cdinsert.pl script also updated to offer barcode printing.

  * June 2007: form.tmpl now has makegif checked - default is now to
    create a GIF image

  * Apr 2007: cdinsert.pl now used to display initial form, as well as a
    filled-in form to allow for easy corrections/resubmits on the done page.

2002-07-30

  2.4.0

    offset cover/tray image as required

    items are printed on cover, none on the tray card.

    to create RPM [not tested]

2002-01-28

  2.2.0
  cdlabelgen:
  * -v option to support splitting items array into items for cover,

2001-10-25

  2.1.3
  template.ps:

    Bug Report: "Eric L. Schott" <eschott@psu.edu>

2001-07-12

  2.1.2
  2.1.1

  Updated: by Avinash Chopde <avinash@acm.org>  www.aczoom.com

  cdlabelgen:
  * fixed bug where -f <file> containing one item only was being skipped;
    also added code to handle all kinds of end-of-line delimiters in the
    items file - each line is considered to be one item, so need to
    handle all kinds of EOLN characters.
  * -w word wrap was not working, now should work better in all cases

  template.ps:
  * added larger bottom page offset - hopefully, will work on most
    printers using A4 size (Europe)

  * -p option now actually clips text (instead of just clipping
    graphically - used to leave partial letters on the printout)
    now full characters at the end of the string are omitted if needed
    to fit the column

2001-07-06

  2.1.0

  Updated: by Avinash Chopde <avinash@acm.org>  www.aczoom.com

  cdlabelgen:
  * added -p option, pass to template.ps option to clip items
    instead of auto_reducing them to fit to a column

  template.ps:
  * major change to the font size and number of columns
    computation for list of items
    Added option to clip text instead of auto_reducing text to
    fit to column

2001-03-26
  
  2.0.0

  Updated: by Avinash Chopde <avinash@acm.org>  www.aczoom.com

  cdlabelgen:
  * allow skipping either -c or -s option (or both)
  * minor change to insert \n in @items - keeps PostScript DSC
    compliant (as far as possible!) - line length should be < 255 chars
    done to keep warning messages away when using GSview

  template.ps:
  * images can be scaled to completely fill cover and tray card - so
    they can be used as background images.
  * added support directives {#BI} {#B} {#I}, appearing in input text,
    make a line bold-italic, or bold, or italic respectively.
    Directives must appear in column 1 of line.
  * bug fix: in n columns output,  if number of items was not a multiple
    of n, it would leave out the last few items (upto n-1 could be left out).
    Fixed by changing how_many_items calculation
  * if ban (-c) or subban (-s) are empty, skip that line from output title
  * added append function, used to create ban_string_padded
  * changed most %% to %, added %%Page, %%BeginDocument, etc - DSC compliance.
    done to keep warning messages away when using GSview

1999-04-13 05:19  bwf

	* cdlabelgen (1.38), postscript/template.ps (1.25): 
	
	Applied patches submitted by Bernard Quatermass
	<bernard@quatermass.co.uk>. From Bernard's email:
	
	
	The template search routine now puts the found directory at the
	front of the search list for later use.
	
	And there is a common routine for finding a file (and for reading
	its contents) which takes a list of possible directories (as well
	as using the supplied name unmodified). This is used in all file
	open/read cases and allows for the localisation of the undef of $/ 
	and gives the obvious user benefit of being able to specify
	standard .eps files without having to give the full path.
	--------------------8-<-------cut-here---------8-<-----------------
	------ The first is a modification to the template file to provide
	the extra tongue need for clear trays. The contents will be the
	same as the endcaps but centered. ... The second modification
	provides the mean to explicitly specify the location of the
	template file. This was of great use to me when testing the new
	template and allows one to override the search path.
